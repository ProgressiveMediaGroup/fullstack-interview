# Progressive Content: Full-stack Technical Test
This project is used as a technical test when interviewing potential full-stack web developers for Progressive Content.

## Installation Instructions
This project is designed to use Docker, so that you have a working duplicate of our test environment.

### Prerequisites
You will need the following applications to install and run this project:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

### Actual Installation
To install the project, you will need to:

1. From your command line, run:

   ```git clone https://github.com/ProgressiveMediaGroup/fullstack-interview.git```

   This will download a clone of the fullstack-interview project to your machine, into the 'fullstack-interview' sub-folder.


2. From your command line, run:

   ```cd fullstack-interview```

   This will take you into the newly-cloned Git repository.

### Starting the test environment
Run the following from your command line:

```docker-compose up```

This will build and start the docker containers required, and will expose WordPress on port 8000. You can access it on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If it hasn't already done so, it will also create the 'db_data' and 'wordpress' sub-folders. These are mapped volumes used by Docker to maintain file state when they are not running.

You can access all the files for your WordPress instance within the 'wordpress' sub-folder.

### Stopping the test environment
Run the following from your command line:

```docker-compose down```

This will stop all the docker containers, freeing the allocated resources and ports.

This will not delete any of the files within the 'db_data' and 'wordpress' sub-folders.

## Task Instructions
We need you to write a widget for a WordPress site that will contain links to the site ownerâ€™s Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles.

The site owner must be allowed to specify their usernames for those sites when adding the widget in the WordPress back-end.

The front-end design of the widget is not important.

This test should take between 1 and 2 hours, although this is purely a guide.
